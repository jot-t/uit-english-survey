# UIT Student Foreign Language Certificate Survey

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the current status of foreign language proficiency and certification among students at the University of Information Technology (UIT) - VNU-HCM. The survey was initiated at the request of the **Head of the Faculty of Information Science and Engineering** to gather insights into student needs, challenges, and motivations regarding foreign language learning and examination.

## üìä The Report

The final 27-page report analyzes the survey data, providing key insights into:
* **Overall Statistics:** A general overview of the 1,148 respondents, broken down by academic year, major, and faculty.
* **Students Without Certificates:** An analysis of the challenges this group faces, their target certificates (primarily IELTS and TOEIC), and the reasons for delaying their exams, such as lack of confidence and prioritizing other academic subjects.
* **Students With Certificates:** An examination of this group's motivations, study methods, and the types of certificates they hold. The data shows a rising trend in students obtaining certificates like IELTS before entering university.
* **Recommendations:** Concrete suggestions for the university based on student feedback, including calls for more specialized exam preparation courses (IELTS, TOEIC), enhanced speaking and writing skills training, and financial support for exam fees.
